It receives a packages with type kdeconnect.filetransfer. If they have a payload
attached, it will download it as a file with the filename set in the field
"filename" (string). If that field is not set it should generate a filename.

<TODO>
If the content transferred is text, it can be sent in a field "text" (string)
instead of an attached payload. In that case, this plugin opens a text editor
with the content instead of saving it as a file.
